Rainbow Relaxation
=================

This is an Android app conceptualized and partially coded by my wife. It uses out-of-phase sine wave calculations to generate transitions of colors throughout the spectrum of the rainbow.

By touching the screen, a setting dialog is displayed which allows the user to adjust the speed of the transition and the number of color steps in the cycle.
